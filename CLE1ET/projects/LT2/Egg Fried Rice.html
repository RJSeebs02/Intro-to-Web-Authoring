        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Rice (as much as you fancy really!)</li>
                <li>Half an onion (Or more, again if you can fancy it)</li>
                <li>A tin of sweetcorn</li>
                <li>A few mushrooms</li>
                <li>1-2 eggs</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Methods</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Start cooking the rice howebver you do, and put some oil in a frying pan.</li>
                <li>Chop the onion into bits, any size really, doesn't matter particularly and throw into the frying pan.</li>
                <li>Chop the mushrooms and add to the onions.</li>
                <li>Once the rice is cooked, drain it off and add it into the frying pan.</li>
                <li>Tip the drained sweetcorn into the pan as well and stir it all up.</li>
                <li>Break the eggs into the pan (OR beat them together in another bowl and tip into the frying pan) and stir the mixture up.</li>
                <li>At this point, you need to keep stirring the mixture, keeping the eggs moving. Keep going until the eggs haved cooked, should take about 5-8 minutes maybe?</li>
