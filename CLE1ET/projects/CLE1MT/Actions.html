            <h1><span class='SpecialWords'>ACTIONS/SOLUTIONS</span></h1>
            <p>We all know that poverty is a huge problem in the Philippines and a huge number of people are a victim of it. With some researches and ideas we created, here are some of the solutions or answers to solving poverty in our country.</p>
        </div>
        <h2><span class='SpecialWords'>Greater Access to Education</span></h2>
        <p><img src="Greater Education.jpg"><br>You may think that this is nonsense since there are schools which offer free education to children but no, it's not totally free if we may say. Public schools exist which are responsible for offering free education but the problem is majority of the public schools here in the Philippines have high standards or not that easy qualifications that huge number of students are not able to pass the qualifications of some public schools. Due to this, students are forced to dropout especially in college. The government, CHED, and DepEd should make schools which are available and suitable for those students who have not passed entrance exams of their desired school. Education is one of the best solutions to poverty. Globally speaking, even the most basic education: reading, writing and arithmetic can open doors for children that would otherwise be locked tight. But it’s more than that.
            Many experts say that the cycle of poverty simply can’t be broken unless children receive education.</p>
        
        <h2><span class='SpecialWords'>Stop Corruption</span></h2>
        <p><img src="Corruption.jpg"><br>The government is the one responsible for poverty. It is true that the government had lend some help and even still try to combat poverrty but the problem is many people sitting in the positions of the government are involved in corruption. Examples of corruption are graft, bribery, favouritism, nepotism, impunity, embezzlement, extortion, racketeering, fraud, tax evasion, lack of transparency, lack of sufficient enforcement of laws and government policies, and consistent lack of support for human rights. Due to some politicians spending the country's money for their personal goods, many projects are being delayed making poverty seemingly endless. Corruption should be solved as soon as possible and the country will develop drastically.</p>
    
        <h2><span class='SpecialWords'>Quality Education</span></h2>
        <p><img src="Quality Education.jpg"><br>Education is provided to have a better life and achieve someone's dream. The problem with education is that it lacks to teach and motivate students to achieve their full potential and finish school. Because of this, many students drop out not finishing college, some do not even graduate highschool. Not being able to graduate lowers your chance to get a job which results to poverty.</p>
